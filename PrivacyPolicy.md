# Privacy Policy for 2ToDo

**Effective Date:** December 12, 2025

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **2ToDo** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience on our website and in using our mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1. Location Data
Our App uses your device's location services to provide core functionality, specifically to:
*   Identify and sort "Nearby" To-Do lists.
*   Display lists based on their proximity to your current location.
*   Trigger notifications or widgets updates when you are within the radius of a specific To-Do list location.

This location data is processed locally on your device or your personal iCloud account. We do not transmit your location history to any external servers or third parties for tracking or advertising purposes.

### 2.2. User Content
We collect the data you explicitly enter into the App, including:
*   Task names, descriptions, and notes.
*   Deadlines and dates.
*   List names and associated settings (e.g., radius, icons).

### 2.3. Usage Data
The App does not collect personally identifiable usage analytics or tracking data.

## 3. How We Use Collected Information
We use the collected information solely to:
*   Provide, maintain, and improve the App's functionality.
*   Synchronize your data across your devices (e.g., iPhone and Apple Watch) using Apple's iCloud and Watch Connectivity services.

## 4. Data Storage and Synchronization
*   **Local Storage:** Your data is stored locally on your device.
*   **iCloud:** If you have iCloud enabled, your data (including lists and location tags) may be stored in your private iCloud container to synchronize across your devices. We do not have access to your private iCloud data.
*   **Watch Connectivity:** Data is transferred securely between your paired iPhone and Apple Watch to ensure widgets and the watch app are up to date.

## 5. Third-Party Services
We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information to others. The App relies on Apple's ecosystem services (iOS, watchOS, iCloud) which are subject to Apple's own privacy policies.

## 6. Your Rights
You may stop the collection of location information at any time by disabling location services for the App in your device's Settings. You can delete all user content by deleting your lists within the App or by uninstalling the App, which will remove locally stored data.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or within the App.

## 8. Contact Us
If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.
