## Location-Based Features

### How Location Reminders Work

When you add a location to a list:
- 2ToDo creates a **geofence** (virtual boundary) around that location
- When you **enter the radius**, you get a notification
- The notification shows which tasks are on that list
- Perfect for remembering things when you're at the store, office, or home!

### Setting Up Location Reminders

1. **Create or edit a list**
2. **Add a location** using one of these methods:
   - **Pick on Map**: Browse and select any location
   - **Current Location**: Use where you are right now
   - **Favorites**: Choose from previously saved locations
3. **Adjust the radius** (25-500m):
   - Smaller radius: More precise, triggers when very close
   - Larger radius: Triggers earlier, good for busy areas
4. **Save the list**

### Editing a List's Location

1. **Open the list**
2. **Tap the pencil icon** next to the location card
3. **Modify** the location, name, or radius
4. **Tap "Save"** to update

### Managing Favorite Locations

### Location Permissions

**Always Allow** (Recommended):

**While Using**:

## Tips & Best Practices

### 🎯 Organizing Your Lists

- **Use descriptive names**: "Grocery - Whole Foods" vs just "Groceries"
- **One location per list**: Don't mix errands from different places
- **Keep tasks specific**: "Buy 2% milk" vs "Buy milk"
- **Archive completed lists**: Keep your main view clean

### 📍 Location Tips

- **Set appropriate radius**:
  - Small stores: 50-100m
  - Shopping centers: 200-300m
  - Neighborhoods: 300-500m
- **Test your geofences**: Walk by to ensure they trigger
- **Use favorites**: Save frequently visited locations
- **Update locations**: If a store moves, update the list

### 🤝 Collaboration Tips

- **Communicate**: Add notes to explain tasks
- **Use "Specific Users"**: For private family lists
- **Check activity**: See what others have done
- **Be respectful**: Don't delete others' tasks without asking

### ⏰ Deadline Strategy

- **Set realistic deadlines**: Give yourself enough time
- **Use for important tasks**: Not every list needs a deadline
- **Review regularly**: Check upcoming deadlines in your lists
- **Combine with location**: Deadline + location = powerful reminder

### 🏆 Achievement Motivation

- **Start small**: Set achievable daily goals
- **Build gradually**: Increase goals as you improve
- **Track progress**: Check your stats regularly
- **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge your streaks!
